# typr


A buttery-smooth, blazingly fast tui-based typing app inspired by monkeytype
that allows you to practice typing so that you, too, can be _blazingly fast_!

This project is built entirely using Claude Code. To build it, use
```go
go build
./typr
```
The total development time for this was around 60 minutes and $5. Outside this
README and the `architecture.md`, I have contributed nothing to this project as
of the initial commit.
